### Who Am I?
Hi, I'm Thomas, and my art alias/username is trustmeiexist. I'm a self taught 3D technical artist with 7+ years of experience, looking to expand my horizons and build my skillet. Originally all of this started as a mission to create assets for my own game, and over time, I developed a passion for all things 3D. It's difficult sometimes not to get lost in a project, because details are important to me, and hyperfocus is a wonderful thing.

### What Am I?
My skills which might be useful are as follows:
* Character and prop design
* Concept art and mock-up models
* Optimization and conservation of resources
* Texture painting and UV Mapping
* Eagle eye for rendering errors (thank you MMOs)
* More random information than any human would need

### I'm always ready for the next commission, and I'm constantly honing my skills. So, whether you're here to stay, or passing through on your way to parts unknown, welcome, to my TOS (Terms Of Service).

All in all, my rules aren't actually that strict, but they are important, so without further ado:
* I have the right to refuse any request, for any reason, at any time.
* Payment is _expected_ half up-front, though my store on commiss.io is recommended for ease.
* Prices may increase with complexity.
* Scams will **not** be tolerated, and will be sold online.
* Files will be released on request, in any _reasonable_ format you desire. (.obj,.fbx,etc)
* Currently, I do not do NSFW.
* Finally, my only request as far as licensing goes, is to credit myself, and to alert me _before_ I take on the project, if you're planning on commercial use.

Thank you for reading, have a fantastic day!
